# UofM website refactor challenge

## Description
  The goal of this project was to refactor code for the main page of the Horiseon website (without changing anything on said page). This project was built to deepen our knowledge of basic HTML and CSS through practical application. Initially, the HTML and CSS files were disorganized, outdated with div elements, and contained redundancies. After this refactoring project, the files are organized in sequential order, labelled with semantic elements (HTML), and consolidated with broadly-applicable classes. This project was also effective in helping us better understand the connection between our HTML and CSS codes.
